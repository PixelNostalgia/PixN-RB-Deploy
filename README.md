The script, often referred to as the "Pixelfication Script" will turn a
regular install of RetroBat into the RGS build. This means you will be
able to install our build on pretty much any size storage and no longer
need to download a large base image. Once you have the barebones build
installed, you can then browse our ROMpacks and download the ones you want.

Note:
The script is designed to only be used with these specific versions of RetroBat:

v7.3.0  -  v7.4.0.2  -  v7.5.0.0

The RetroBat website only provides the latest version available. If you need one of the versions above, take a look here:

Steps:

1. Download RetroBat from their official website: https://www.retrobat.org/

2. Download the version of the deploy script that matches your version of RetroBat
   (For RetroBat v7.5.0.0 grab PixN-RB-v7.5.0.0-Deploy.v1.xx.cmd)

3. Exclude the RetroBat folder from your Anti-Virus software (Windows Defender etc)

4. Place the deploy script file in the root of the RetroBat folder.

5. Double-click the deploy script to run it.

6. Wait.......make a drink etc...

7. When the script has finished, check the "- PixN_ReadMe.txt" in the root of the RetroBat folder.

8. Download any additional ROMpacks you want: https://pixelnostalgia.github.io/

9. Launch RetroBat and run the 'PixN Update Service' from the RetroBat item on the wheel.
   (Just to check you have all the latest updates. fixes etc)
